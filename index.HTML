    <h1> <STRong>EV BIKE</STRong></h1>
    <p><BLOckquote>An EV bike, or electric bike, is a modern two-wheeler powered by an electric motor and rechargeable battery instead of petrol or diesel. Designed for eco-friendly transportation, EV bikes produce zero tailpipe emissions and offer a smooth, quiet ride. They are cost-effective to run, with electricity being much cheaper than fuel, and require less maintenance since they do not have complex engine parts like gears, clutches, or oil systems. Depending on the model, an EV bike can cover 50 to 250 kilometers on a single charge and reach speeds ranging from 25 km/h for basic scooters to over 120 km/h for performance motorcycles. Charging usually takes  hours on a regular socket, with fast-charging options available in advanced models. With growing concerns about pollution and rising fuel costs, EV bikes are becoming a popular choice for daily commuting as well as sustainable urban mobility..</p></BLOckquote>
